# Global-Economic-Trends-in-2021

In this project, I have explored and visualized key economic indicators from World Bank datasets using Tableau. The interactive dashboard presents insightful analyses of inflation rates, population growth, unemployment rates, foreign direct investment, and gross domestic product for various countries.

**Project Highlights**

    Worldwide Inflation Rate Map: An interactive map showcasing the variation in inflation rates across different countries. Users can explore inflation trends by region and identify countries experiencing higher or lower inflation rates.

    Population Growth vs Unemployment Rate: Visualization highlighting the potential relationship between population growth and unemployment rates. The interactive chart allows users to investigate whether there are any correlations or patterns between these indicators.

    Foreign Direct Investment vs Gross Domestic Product: Interactive scatter plot demonstrating the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and gross domestic product (GDP). Users can explore how FDI influences a country's economic performance.

    Top Countries Attracting Foreign Direct Investment: A ranked list and bar chart showcasing the countries that attracted the highest foreign direct investment in 2021. Users can easily identify the most attractive investment destinations.

    Countries with the Highest and Lowest GDP Annual Growth: A bar chart highlighting the countries with the highest and lowest GDP annual growth rates. Users can compare economic performance across countries.

**How to Use**

The Tableau workbook file (.twbx) containing the interactive dashboard is available in this repository's "Tableau" folder. Simply download the file and open it using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader to explore the visualizations and gain valuable insights into economic trends in 2021.
